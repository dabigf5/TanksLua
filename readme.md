# TanksLua
TanksLua is an extension for Tanks: The Crusades which enables Lua scripting through various means (see next sections).\
Please note that this extension is quite early in development, and highly subject to change.

## Features
### Level Scripts
Level Scripts are directories or zip archives containing script files or assets, with a necessary `level.lua` script which specifies the Lua callbacks for whenever the level is loaded, updated, drawn, etc.

### Lua Extensions
Similar to Level Scripts, Lua Extensions are directories or zip archives containing script files or assets, with a necessary `extension.lua` which specifies the Lua callbacks for whenever the extension is loaded, the game is updated, drawn, etc.
